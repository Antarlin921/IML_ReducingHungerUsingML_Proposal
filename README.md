# IML_ReducingHungerUsingML_Proposal
Machine Learning Project to present an idea on how we can try to bridge the gap between food wastage  and needy people.

India is ranked at 101st position amongst 116 countries on Global Hunger Index in 2021 which is a drop in rank from 96th position last year. According to the food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 189.2 million people are undernourished in India which is 14% of the total population. Thus, the hunger issue is one of the major challenges India faces, which has also increased due to the ongoing pandemic. 
We want to address the issue of equally distributing the food from various food outlets to the target audience with the help of proper mapping of these individuals and dividing them into clusters where they live and the size of the cluster city-wise. We can connect the local eateries and their per-day wastage or 
free food they can donate based on this data. 

Note-This project is is preliminary stage.The actual modelling phase has not been done.Only project design and plan had been done.Like what is the problem? why we need to address 
it?How and where to collect data?Which ML Models to use?What is the future scope and plan.
